More details about the fund on the [4TU community website](https://community.data.4tu.nl/the-fair-data-fund/).

The FAIR Data Fund offers researchers an opportunity to apply for financial aid to cover the costs of making their datasets FAIR:
Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (the FAIR principles). We believe in the added value and benefit of making research data FAIR.

Following on the previous successes, this year we will again accept applications from researchers and research projects from Delft University of
Technology, University of Twente, Eindhoven University of Technology and Wageningen University & Research! We will announce 8 winners and they will
receive a budget up of to 5000€ for their projects. Watch this space for more updates.
