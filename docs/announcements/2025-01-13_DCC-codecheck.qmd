In addition to its existing code and data office hours, the TU Delft DCC is offering a
limited number of codecheck appointments, and slots are open and available to
[book on their website](https://www.tudelft.nl/library/support/library-voor-onderzoekers/onderzoek-starten/dcc/code-data-office-hours)
(under ‘category of appointment’, you can select ‘codecheck’).

Do you have code and data related to a project or paper/pre-print that you would like
to check? During a codecheck appointment, a member of the DCC will work with you to
review your code and check that it is reproducible, and issue a certificate if it is!
You can add this certificate to your own repository, and also cite it in the
supplementary materials of journal submissions, showing that your code is reproducible.

Think this is something for you? Book your slot now! You can reach out to the DCC at
[dcc@tudelft.nl](mailto:dcc@tudelft.nl) with any questions you have about the process.
