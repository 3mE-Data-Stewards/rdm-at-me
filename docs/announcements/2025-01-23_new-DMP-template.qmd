In 2025, TU Delft launched a new version of its Data Management Plan (DMP) template. 
When creating a new DMP, ensure you are using this updated template, which can be accessed 
through the [DMP-online platform](https://dmponline.tudelft.nl/public_templates).

The 2025 template replaces the earlier 2021 version and introduces several 
improvements, such as broader response options, clearer guidance, and a more 
intuitive arrangement of questions to enhance user experience.

For more information or advice, you can contact the faculty data stewards, 
Bjorn Bartholdy and Sara Shoghi, at [datasteward-ME@tudelft.nl](mailto:datasteward-ME@tudelft.nl).
